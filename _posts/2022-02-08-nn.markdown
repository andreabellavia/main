Test post.

I have been recently explored R packages to fit neural networks. [This paper](https://www.inmodelia.com/exemples/2021-0103-RJournal-SM-AV-CD-PK-JN.pdf) provides an excellent discussion of all available packages (January 2021).
Among the possible options there is `neuralnet` that offer several documentation:
- [Github page](https://github.com/bips-hb/neuralnet)
- [Including cross validation](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/creating-visualizing-neural-network-in-r/)
- [datasience+ post](https://datascienceplus.com/neuralnet-train-and-test-neural-networks-using-r/)
- [R-bloggers post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2015/09/fitting-a-neural-network-in-r-neuralnet-package/)
 
[This function](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2013/08/variable-importance-in-neural-networks/)
 can be used for variable importance

{% highlight r %}
results<-gar.fun('y',nn)
plot(results)
a<-results$data
{% endhighlight %}
